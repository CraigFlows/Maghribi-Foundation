# Welcome to ICS 690!

In this course we'll be collaborating on a DAO blockchain project.

What is blockchain technology? What is decentralization? What is the future of this technology and its relation to business and society?  

Our goal is to understand the answers to these questions on a deep and practical level. I’ll provide the theory and give you technical goals. 
1. Work your way through the tutorials and put that programming knowledge into use. 
2. Collaborate on a new network/startup/DAO with your class members.  

Perspective: Group work sucks. But it's essential for business. Our work is not valuable if we don’t get off the ground, so don’t be jealous or selfish. At the same time, fair compensation/recognition is essential or we’ll fail. … How to resolve this? We just muddle through. If we’re are honest and generous, it will work. If we’re not, it won’t. Don’t waste your time with quarreling with someone who is trying to get credit they don’t deserve. We’re all guilty of this at some time. Move on and collaborate with someone who generously creates value. Help them instead. You need to be as generous, diligent, and honest as possible to make a group project work.

Failing at this group project is the most likely outcome—-most startups fail. But it’s still a valuable lesson in learning how to collaborate, and how not to collaborate. 

### Grades: 
The hope is to get the whole group to develop a single DAO/Network. We’ll start with a vision I’ve created. Hopefully we’ll end with a completed DAO. Quite likely it will “fork” and people will go off on their own project. [That’s OK!] But if it doesn’t fork, here’s what could possibly result.
-	 Each student in the class will have contributed to some aspect of building a functional decentralized network, initially titled, The Maghribi Foundation.
   -  Gain working knowledge of how to use and develop P2P tools in a blockchain context.
   -  Completing the foundation may contribute to your master’s thesis, or possibly you may complete your whole master’s thesis if the final writeup is good enough.
   -  I have a book contract with De Gruyter’s for writing a text. If you contribute well, I’ll add you to the acknowledgments. If you contribute a lot, make great documentation, and allow me to use it for the book, you can be a co-author. Whatever website or GitHub repository or YouTube marketing video we manage to construct, we’ll feature the contributors’ names prominently. If it’s successful it’s a line in your resume. 
   -  The DAO may work. So you may have an architect’s credit for a new type of economic organization that history has never seen before. You may be a zillyunaire. You may transform human behavior. You may save humanity. Odds of that happening? Not very high. But in no other class have I every seriously posited the possibility. I’m a mathematician. I teach about things that are at least 400 years old each time I step in front of a class. It’s a very weird fact about this moment in history and technology that you might end up changing the world with the things we produce in this class.

If it does FORK catastrophically, then that stuff won’t happen. But at least you’ll viscerally understand the impact of network forks. None of the above outcomes are necessary to successfully complete this class—-the minimum requirement is to finish a final writeup reviewing what you learned in the class. (If you contribute less, then your final writeup is more important. If your contributions are clear and substantial, the writeup is less important.)

Grades at the end of the class are only an issue if we fork into too many groups and get into individual projects. Then your grade will be based on your individual writeup. Otherwise your grade is based on your documented contributions… GitHub, weekly presentations, show me your finished tutorials, show me your collaboration and work… 

### The goal of the Maghribi Foundation: Creating a system for using reputation tokens to motivate and direct a DAO.

  
Here’s the deal: we want to “move fast and break things” with this startup. We will make suggestions and implement them quickly. We’ll fail spectacularly. The things we create will be big mistakes. But we keep moving and improve. Each mistake makes us wiser, humbler, stronger, more determined and confident we’ll succeed.   
 




# Maghribi Foundation
## Reputation driven DAOs

We're building a complete DAO from the ground up. Complete means it has a secure and meaningful reputation token. Reputation tokens are difficult to engineer. They need to be attuned to the purpose of the DAO, to motivate its members' with the right incentives and prevent adverse behavior which might destroy the DAO. 

The notion of reputation has eroded in our society. This is happening at the same time our social institutions are collapsing from the global cultural revolution that stems from the new IT we've built. Money is not the right incentive for creating cohesion and harmony in a group, reputation is. Reputation incentivizes good behavior in the long run. We need a protocol for making reputation meaningful again. 

China is developing a centralized reputation mechanism called the social credit system (SCS). Because the SCS is a centralized, monolithic, non-transparent platform that ignores individual privacy, there are many scary consequences for individuals. The CPC’s goal is to control their citizen’s behavior, their future, and their children’s future. On the contrary, we're building a Web3 reputation mechanism to empower individuals and society with a more balanced architecture. We seek greater individual autonomy and power over our private information, while incentivizing social collaboration with bureacratic transparency. Building many different reputation tokens for diverse open DAOs that have opt-in participation creates a decentralized alternative to the SCS. 

Maghribi reputation tokens have publicly transparent rules, they protect users’ privacy with the same public key cryptography that protects your money when you shop online, and they are incorruptible in the sense that no central entity is capable of bestowing reputation or taking it away by fiat. If you benefit the DAO, you gain reputation. If you harm the DAO, you lose reputation. By engineering meaningful reputation tokens and building beneficial DAOs for improving our economy, we are attempting no less of a deed than saving society. We're fixing democracy with open, transparent, reputation-weighted collaboration, using the same technological tools that are currently eroding our institutions to save them. Saving the world is the most exciting adventure anyone can choose in life, and there is nothing more valuable anyone could hope to materially achieve.



## Value statement
Our goal is to use the tools of technology to revolutionize global society while preserving the best achievements of society’s past from the corruption of our current systems. Corruption is defined as organizational inefficiency measured against how well the organization moves toward our values. 

3 axes of value split between the individual and the group. We strive to improve each polar opposite simultaneously.
1. Individual autonomy and social cohesion. We value individual autonomy and want to maximize each individual’s power and material wealth and recognize this is only possible when individuals choose greater submission to group cohesion. At the same time, the group must bow to the supremacy of the individual by respecting their rights. 
2. Personal privacy and bureaucratic transparency. We protect privacy of personal information while maintaining transparency of group information. 
3. Meritocracy and equity. We strive to properly valuate individual contributions toward the group in an efficient meritocracy for nonessentials while striving to fairly share the essentials with the group through a generous system of equity. The argument about the distinction between what is essential and inessential is necessary to protect individual rights but damaging to group cohesion.

We want to upgrade democracy with new technologies, eternally building a system where we filter individuals with the best objective understanding and wisdom into proper positions of power in a governmental bureaucracy that effectively and efficiently promotes our values, values which generate a cohesive group that supports individual sovereignty and dignity.

Most importantly we strive to never be enslaved by these technological tools. We will always value the spirit of our laws that unite our group over the letter of the laws that drive our group. We pursue the transcendental purpose eternally beyond the formal description of any future version of our constitution.
