## Reputation driven DAOs

We're building a complete DAO from the ground up. Complete means it has a secure and meaningful reputation token. Reputation tokens are difficult to engineer. They need to be attuned to the purpose of the DAO, to motivate its members' with the right incentives and prevent adverse behavior which might destroy the DAO. 

The notion of reputation has eroded in our society. This is happening at the same time our social institutions are collapsing from the global cultural revolution that stems from the new IT we've built. Money is not the right incentive for creating cohesion and harmony in a group, reputation is. Reputation incentivizes good behavior in the long run. We need a protocol for making reputation meaningful again. 

China is developing a centralized reputation mechanism called the social credit system (SCS). Because the SCS is a centralized, monolithic, non-transparent platform that ignores individual privacy, there are many scary consequences for individuals. The CPC’s goal is to control their citizen’s behavior, their future, and their children’s future. On the contrary, we're building a Web3 reputation mechanism to empower individuals and society with a more balanced architecture. We seek greater individual autonomy and power over our private information, while incentivizing social collaboration with bureacratic transparency. Building many different reputation tokens for diverse open DAOs that have opt-in participation creates a decentralized alternative to the SCS. 

Maghribi reputation tokens have publicly transparent rules, they protect users’ privacy with the same public key cryptography that protects your money when you shop online, and they are incorruptible in the sense that no central entity is capable of bestowing reputation or taking it away by fiat. If you benefit the DAO, you gain reputation. If you harm the DAO, you lose reputation. By engineering meaningful reputation tokens and building beneficial DAOs for improving our economy, we are attempting no less of a deed than saving society. We're fixing democracy with open, transparent, reputation-weighted collaboration, using the same technological tools that are currently eroding our institutions to save them. Saving the world is the most exciting adventure anyone can choose in life, and there is nothing more valuable anyone could hope to materially achieve.



## Value statement
Our goal is to use the tools of technology to revolutionize global society while preserving the best achievements of society’s past from the corruption of our current systems. Corruption is defined as organizational inefficiency measured against how well the organization moves toward our values. 

3 axes of value split between the individual and the group. We strive to improve each polar opposite simultaneously.
1. Individual autonomy and social cohesion. We value individual autonomy and want to maximize each individual’s power and material wealth and recognize this is only possible when individuals choose greater submission to group cohesion. At the same time, the group must bow to the supremacy of the individual by respecting their rights. 
2. Personal privacy and bureaucratic transparency. We protect privacy of personal information while maintaining transparency of group information. 
3. Meritocracy and equity. We strive to properly valuate individual contributions toward the group in an efficient meritocracy for nonessentials while striving to fairly share the essentials with the group through a generous system of equity. The argument about the distinction between what is essential and inessential is necessary to protect individual rights but damaging to group cohesion.

We want to upgrade democracy with new technologies, eternally building a system where we filter individuals with the best objective understanding and wisdom into proper positions of power in a governmental bureaucracy that effectively and efficiently promotes our values, values which generate a cohesive group that supports individual sovereignty and dignity.

Most importantly we strive to never be enslaved by these technological tools. We will always value the spirit of our laws that unite our group over the letter of the laws that drive our group. We pursue the transcendental purpose eternally beyond the formal description of any future version of our constitution.
